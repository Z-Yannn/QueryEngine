# Query Engine
  
This project achieved:
* Designed and implemented an XQuery-based query processor for parsing, executing and optimising XQuery statements to process XML data models.
* Built an abstract syntax tree for parsing and executing XQuery expressions, including advanced features such as element concatenation and recursive evaluation, using Java and the ANTLR 4 parser generator.


## XPath

  
Navigate to the directory which has Xpath.jar. Save the Xpath query in `input.txt`.

  

To run the Xpath query, execute

```bash

java -cp .:Xpath.jar XpathEXE input.txt output.xml

```

The output will be stored in ```output.xml```

  

## XQuery

 
Navigate to the directory which has Xquery.jar. Save the Xquery query in `input.txt`. The function is designed based on Xpath hence it is compatible with the all previous Xpath queries.

 

To run the Xquery query, execute

```bash

java -cp .:QueryEnginee.jar Execution.XqueryEXE input.txt output.xml

```

The output will be stored in `output.xml`
